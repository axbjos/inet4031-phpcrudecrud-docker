#  INET4031 PHP Crude CRUD App

## Containerizing the PHP Crude CRUD App using Docker

Clone this respository to a Linux VM running Docker(1)

Use the Docker Container development stack created in Module 12 to create a Docker Container from the Dockerfile.

This Dockerfile will create a container that only contains the Apache, PHP, and PHP Crude CRUD app code. The MySQL database is not installed in the container.  It is possible to do so, but would be bad form. Instead our Database will be running elsewhere.  Joe will explain in class.




(1) If using Docker Desktop you could also clone this to your host Mac or Windows OS machine.
